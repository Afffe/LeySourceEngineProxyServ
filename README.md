# LeySourceEngineProxyServ
 Ley Proxy Servers for Source engine servers - Zyre. Think of cloudflare but for source engine and with geo-cast based server ping enhancing for free. I've created this tool to A. protect my servers by hiding their real IP entirely. The only visible IPs will be the node IPs. And B. to artifically enhance the ping on the server list of source servers to get more players to join. Unlike anycast this does not have any costs besides your server costs. It avoids duplicates by only letting the location geographically closest (latitude, longtitude)  respond to the user. This could potencially be enhanced by using e.g. automatic detection of nodes being down/up or automatic IP switching combined with GSLT to basically make your servers non ddosable.
